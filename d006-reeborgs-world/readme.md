# Reeborg's World

The project for this day was to program a _robot_ to be able to escape a
maze, the problem was hosted in [reeborg.ca](https://reeborg.ca) and the
link to the specific problem is
[here](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json).

Because the problem and the solution is dependent on that website, it is
not included in this repo.
