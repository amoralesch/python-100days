# Stock Trading News Alert

# Track the price of a stock, and when the price varies a lot, check
# the news for any reason, then alert a user about it.
#
# Originally planned to use SMS for the alerts, but because it is not
# possible to create a free account on Twilio without providing a real
# phone number, it was modified to use email instead.
#
# More practice with the existing concepts, nothing new on this day.
